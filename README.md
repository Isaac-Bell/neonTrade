  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
  - **Bollinger Bands**: Uses a moving average and two standard deviations to create upper and lower bands, indicating volatility and potential reversal points.
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Combines moving averages to show changes in strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
